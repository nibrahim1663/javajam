JavaJam Coffee Bar
Julio Perez is the owner of the JavaJam Coffee Bar, a gourmet coffee shop that serves snacks, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. 
Local folk music performances and poetry readings are held a few nights during the week. The customers of JavaJam are mainly 
college students and young professionals. Julio would like a web presence for his shop that will display his services and 
provide a calendar for the performances.  He would like a home page, menu page, music performance schedule page, and job 
opportunities page.
